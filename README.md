## Git vs. GitHub

**Git** takes snapshots of your code so later on you can go back to your code to 
 make changes. 

**Github** is an online server where you store your snapshots from Git. 

Be more specific

## Initial Setup

**Cloud 9** and **Github** are both linked meaning they work with each other. First, you have to connect your cloud 9 repository to your Github repository.

## Repository Setup
To set up your repository you have to start by initializing Git. Initalizing Git 
will turn a directory into a repository. 

Initializing Git = `git init` How you get your commands

Repository = `repo` Where you store your files 

After initializing git with `git init` you will have to go to the Github website and add a new repo onto your Github profile (give it a name and fill out the other information given).Then you go back to C9 and type the command line `git clone URL` in the bash terminal to clone the repo on to C9.

## Workflow & Commands
Git init is an important part of git workflow. It's what starts out your whole workflow process. 

Git add can be thought of as adding someone to your snapshot. It adds the file to be commited. 
 
After you git add, you commit your changes you made to push to your github repository.  
 
 
 `git status` is one of the most important things to use frequently on Git to 
check if your files are added or not added nto the staging area, so later on 
 you can commit.this is also an optional command to view the history of the 
 things you have committed.To see which files are staged they would show up green.
 
 **make sure you have the correct definitions**
