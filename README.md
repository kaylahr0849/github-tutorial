## Git vs. GitHub

**Git** takes snapshots of your code so later on you can go back to your code to 
 make changes.

**Github** is an online server where you store your snapshots from Git.**CAN NOT 
TAKE SNAPSHOTS**

## Initial Setup

**Cloud 9** and **Github** are both linked.meaning

## Repository Setup
To set up your repository you have to start by initializing Git.Initalizing Git 
will turn a directory into a repository.

Initializing Git = `git init`

Repository = `repo`

After initializing git with `git init` you will have to got to Github website and add a new repo onto yout Github profile(give it a name and fill out the other information given).Then you go back to C9 and type the command line `git clone URL` in the bash terminal to clone the repo on to C9.

## Workflow & Commands

 `git add` is used to add a file into the repo(this does NOT mean it has the
 snapshot of the file)
 
 `git commit` is used after you add the file into the repo.Once `git add` has been done,you can make changes to the file and later on commit by typing in `git commit`.
 
 
 `git status` is one of the most important things to use frequently on Git to 
 check if your files are added or not added nto the staging area, so later on 
 you can commit.this is also an optional command to view the history of the 
 things you have committed.To see which files are staged they would show up green.
